      "short": "A powerful memoir of transformation—from witnessing an execution at age three in Sudan, to building AI healthcare solutions in Saudi Arabia. Through the lens of geology, Dr. Mohamed El Fadil shows how life's cracks become engines of innovation.",
      "long": "Geology of the Soul is more than a memoir—it's a philosophical exploration of how pressure, time, and layers create identity. Dr. Mohamed El Fadil takes readers on an extraordinary journey from the banks of the Nile to the digital frontier of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.\n\nAt age three, he witnessed a public execution that shattered his childhood. Exiled to his grandfather's home, bullied at school, he learned that survival requires more than intelligence—it requires understanding systems. From poverty in Khartoum to medical school in Riyadh, from clinical practice to founding BrainSAIT, an AI healthcare company, this is a story of continuous transformation.\n\nUsing geological metaphors—cracks, layers, pressure, and engines—Dr. El Fadil reveals how trauma can become fuel, how migration creates new identities, and how systems thinking can revolutionize healthcare. His six teachers—Death, Sacred Texts, his grandfather Maki, Pain, the Theater of Life, and his son—shaped a journey from treating individual patients to building systems that serve millions.\n\nThis book speaks to anyone carrying their own 'cracks,' searching for their 'engine,' or dreaming of creating impact beyond themselves. It's a testament to resilience, innovation, and the power of seeing challenges not as endings, but as passages for light."
