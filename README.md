## Key Themes

### 🌍 **Geological Metaphors**
- **Cracks** = Life's traumas and challenges
- **Layers** = Accumulated experiences
- **Pressure** = Forces that transform character
- **Engine** = What drives you forward

### 👥 **The Six Teachers**
1. **Death** — Witnessed execution at age 3
2. **Sacred Texts** — Quranic studies as coping mechanism
3. **Maki the Father** — Grandfather's wisdom
4. **Pain** — Medical training and its disillusionment
5. **Theater of Life** — School and society
6. **Maki the Son** — Your son as motivation

### 🔄 **Three Transformations**
1. **Sudan → Saudi Arabia** (Geographical)
2. **Student → Doctor** (Professional)
3. **Doctor → Engineer/Builder** (Philosophical)
