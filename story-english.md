# Geology of the Soul: The Crack and the Engine

**A Novel**

By: Dr. Mohamed El Fadil

---

## Dedication

To **"Maki the Father"**... my grandfather who taught me that roots don't need soil to survive, they need conviction.

To **"Maki the Son"**... the fuel that restarted the engine when rust nearly consumed it.

And to all those who carry a **crack** in their chest, believing it a flaw, when in truth it is a passage for light.

---

## Prologue: A Map Without Borders

I am not a geologist in the academic sense, but I became one by necessity. When you're born on land that cracks beneath your feet, migrate to sands that swallow everything slowly, then study how bodies disintegrate and restructure — reading layers becomes your true profession.

This is not an autobiography in the traditional sense. It is an attempt to draw a **geological map of the soul** — a map that shows how cracks form, how sediments accumulate, and how constant pressure can transform coal into diamond or crush it into dust.

In this journey, the teachers were not always human, nor always books. Here you will meet six harsh teachers who broke me and built me simultaneously:

1. **Death** — The teacher who carries not a stick, but a sword
2. **Sacred Texts** — The compass in a raging sea
3. **Maki the Father** — The solid root in cracked soil
4. **Pain** — The fire that smelts or burns
5. **The Theater of Life** — The school whose lessons never end
6. **Maki the Son** — The fuel that drives the engine

Together, these six drew the topography of my life, where every **crack** that opened onto an abyss transformed over time into an **engine** for survival and immortality.

## Chapter One: The Guillotine of Innocence
### The First Teacher: Death

My consciousness was not shaped by a mother's lullaby or a toy in a courtyard, but at age three, precisely at that geographical point **📍 (28°N 36°E)**. I stood before a rusty iron door in the wall of the "Municipal Mosque." It was the moment the universe decided to teach me its first lesson.

We emerged from Friday prayer to find a human semicircle forming. Then that rusty door opened. The shackled man emerged, his face covered in absolute black. He knelt.

Then came **"The Tap"**: a light tap from the executioner on his back to straighten him, geometric, preparatory.

Then the sword fell.

In less than a second, the head separated. My childhood separated with it. The child died there, and in his place was born a being who understood that **the First Teacher carries not a stick, but a sword**.

---

## Chapter Two: The Silence of Premature Aging
### The Second Teacher: Sacred Texts

After that "Tap," I returned home a body without childhood. I was struck by a terrifying silence. My mother said to my father: "Enroll him in afternoon lessons with Teacher Zughbi, perhaps the Quran will bring him back to us."

Thus I met **the Second Teacher — Sacred Texts**.

I was the youngest child in Teacher Zughbi's circle and the most silent. I wasn't just memorizing; I was trying to understand anything, then reconstruct everything. My traumatized mind operated on **"the scale of death"**: "Why does this child play when he will die?" Then it would reorganize scenarios on **"the scale of survival"**.

The Sacred Texts didn't silence my fear, but gave me **logic** for the chaos of the scene. They gave me the first map: the map of distance between "here" and "there." The compass was in my hand, but the sea still raged.

---

## Chapter Three: The Geology of Poverty

Poverty is not merely the absence of money. Poverty is the continuous erosion of psychological soil, a slow wearing away of protective layers until bare rock is exposed. In our Khartoum neighborhood, poverty was everyone's language, but each house spoke it with a different accent.

My mother washed the ground every morning as if washing poverty's shame from our threshold. Water disappeared quickly into the cracked earth, and the sun restored everything to its original state. A continuous Sisyphean task that refused to acknowledge defeat.

I remember watching the cracks in our room's walls. Zigzag lines telling a history of drought and moisture, expansion and contraction. I didn't know then that I was learning my first lesson in geology: **Earth breathes, buildings move, and every apparent stability hides hidden motion beneath**.

---

## Chapter Four: The Nile as First Teacher

The Nile was not merely a river in my childhood. It was an open classroom teaching lessons not taught in schools. I would sit on its bank for hours, watching how water carries everything: waste and boats, dreams and corpses, history and future.

The Nile taught me the first lesson in **systems thinking**: everything is connected to everything. The water passing before me now came from somewhere distant, and is going somewhere more distant. I am merely a moment in its long journey.

I would throw a pebble in the water and watch the circles expand until they disappeared. I wondered: where does the wave go when we can't see it? Does it cease to exist because we stopped seeing it?

Rain in Sudan has a special smell. When the first drops fall on dry earth, an incomparable scent emerges: a mixture of soil and hope, death and resurrection. Scientists call it **"petrichor,"** but this cold word doesn't do justice to the feeling.

---

## Chapter Five: The First Crack

Every psychological geology has its foundational crack, the event that splits the earth for the first time and determines the course of all subsequent fissures. My first crack was the collapse of part of our house.

It wasn't a dramatic collapse like in movies. It was a slow, resigned collapse. The guest room ceiling began to sag, then cracks appeared in the walls, then on a rainy morning we heard a muffled sound and ran to find the back wall had bent inward.

No one was hurt, but something broke inside me unrelated to brick and cement. The idea of **home as safe haven** broke. The idea of **stability and permanence** broke. I discovered that the ground you stand on might fail you at any moment.

I remember my father's face at that moment. He wasn't just afraid for our lives, but afraid of something deeper: **helplessness**. A man who works his entire life to build a roof over his children's heads, then watches that roof collapse.

---

## Chapter Six: Family Tectonics
### The Third Teacher: Maki the Father

The Sudanese family is a complex tectonic mass. Layers of traditions and customs, some solid as granite, others mobile as magma.

My grandfather, **"Maki the Father"** as we called him, was the fundamental bedrock layer in our family formation. A man from a generation that knew no hesitation. His decisions were like basalt rocks: solid, dark, accepting no discussion. But beneath this hardness was a layer of hidden tenderness.

My grandfather would tell me stories about the land. How the family once owned farmland lost in political upheavals. How farmers read soil like scientists read books.

**"The land doesn't lie,"** he would say. **"People lie, governments lie, but the land always tells the truth. Plant well, harvest well. Neglect it, it neglects you."**

I didn't understand then that he was teaching me the first lesson in **causal thinking**, in the relationship between inputs and outputs, in the idea that results are not random but governed by understandable laws.

---

## Chapter Seven: The Algorithm of Separation

My father decided to start anew in Riyadh. But "bureaucracy" said: father, mother, and infant only. My older sister "Ruwayda" and I were **surplus** in the equation.

The decision was: **exile to Sudan, to Grandfather Maki's house**.

My parents practiced psychological preparation. My sister objected. But me? I was **"busy"**. My mind, that device programmed by the sword's shock and Zughbi's lessons, was working at maximum capacity: drawing scenarios, calculating probabilities.

When the real moment of confrontation came at the airport, the "busy" mind withdrew inside, leaving me to face the separation with a child's body that didn't know how to cry.

---

## Chapter Eight: The Yellow Taxi and Punctured Memory

We landed in Khartoum **📍 (Grandfather Maki's house)**. We rode the "yellow taxi." Its heat and noise were the first sensory shock of exile.

In the spacious house, relatives welcomed us with boisterous warmth. This overwhelming generosity was **"illogical"** in my calculations built on caution.

They asked: "Where is Grandfather Maki?"

They said: "At the market... working from morning to evening. Filling the void his wife left after her passing."

**My mind recorded the note: Work as a means of escaping death.**

Then my aunt asked tenderly: "Do you remember, Mohamed, your grandmother 'Asha'? When you used to walk with her to get milk?"

I looked at her with rigidity. **My old memory (the memory of milk and the shop) was erased and replaced with memory (of sword and blood and yellow taxi).**

I couldn't explain. So I settled for the only answer I mastered: **Silence**.

---

## Chapter Nine: Offering of Cloth and Rust
### The Fifth Teacher: The Theater of Life (School)

The reality of "exile" began. The school was a building that surrendered to despair early. The **iron chair** was the first silent teacher: its sharp protrusions lying in wait for the careless to claim an "offering" from his shirt.

I lost two shirts and pants before learning: **In harsh environments, you must move carefully, or you'll emerge naked.**

But the **"human protrusions"** were harsher. In the students' eyes, I was that child whose flesh grew from "eating apples" and dried under "Gulf air conditioners." They practiced **"preventive bullying"** to break me before I became arrogant.

My "busy" mind was helpless. I was trying to avoid friction through silence, and they interpreted silence as arrogance.

---

## Chapter Ten: The "Basata" Protocol
### Maki the Father: Part Two

Then came the day of explosion. I confronted their leader without calculations. In jungle law, size defeats calculations. I fell. My mouth filled with a terrible taste: a mixture of school dust, my salty sweat, and a rusty taste like the iron that tore my clothes.

I returned home "a heap of defeat."

In the evening, while I was helping my grandfather take out the "beds" to the "courtyard," he spoke the sentence that changed the rules. He didn't ask "Why are you crying?" He said in a strategic tone:

**"What do you think, tonight we bring out another bed here in the courtyard next to me? And we get basata from the factory, and have the girls make us tea, and we have basata... and you tell me what happened to you?"**

My "busy" mind stopped. The word **"basata"** (the rich sweet) was a **passage code** that penetrated all my defenses. It was an irresistible offer: a special bed next to the elder, fresh basata, tea, and an ear that listens.

That night, under Khartoum's sky, I realized that this cold-faced man possessed an **"algorithm"** for healing broken souls: start by filling the stomach with sweets, so the heart opens for conversation.

**Thus began the real lesson with Maki the Father: Strength lies not in not falling, but in knowing who extends their hand to you, and by what ritual, when you fall.**

---

## Chapter Eleven: Seeds of Migration

Migration begins before you pack your bags. It begins as a small idea, a seed that falls into the soil of consciousness and waits for suitable conditions to sprout.

We had relatives in Saudi Arabia. They came during holidays with fancy cars and new clothes and gifts for everyone. They spoke of doubled salaries, modern infrastructure, endless opportunities. I would listen and imagine: what if I were there?

But migration is not merely geographical movement. It is separation from your initial layers, from the soil that shaped you.

My father was more clear: **"Go. Build your lives. Don't look back."** He said it with firmness hiding sadness. A man who knows the limits of what he can offer, pushing his children to go where those limits end.

---

## Chapter Twelve: The First Farewell

Not every farewell happens at an airport or station. Some farewells happen in ordinary moments you don't realize are final until later.

Before I left, I stood on the Nile's bank for the last time. I didn't know it was the last, but something inside me knew. I threw a pebble in the water, watched the circles expand, and said to myself: **I will return. I don't know when, but I will return.**

I didn't return. Not as I imagined at least. The child who threw the pebble died on the way to Saudi Arabia, and someone else was born in his place.

This is not sadness, it's a geological observation: **Transformation is not death, it is a change of state**.

---

# Part Two: The Isthmus of Golden Sands
**(Saudi Arabia: Desert Formation)**

---

## Chapter Thirteen: The Shock of Color

The first thing I noticed in Saudi Arabia was color. Or rather, the absence of colors.

Sudan was green and brown and the blue of the Nile. Saudi Arabia was **yellow**. Yellow everywhere. Sand and rocks and sky pale from heat.

This wasn't a negative impression, but shocking in its neutrality. The desert doesn't care about your arrival or departure. It was here millions of years before you, and will remain millions after. This indifferent reception was a lesson in humility.

The transition from Nile banks to the heart of the desert was a geological shift by all measures: from soil rich with river sediments to sand containing nothing but silica. From humidity clinging to skin to dryness that cracks lips in minutes.

---

## Chapter Fourteen: The Economics of Feeling

The desert taught me what I call **"the economics of feeling"**. In a harsh environment, you cannot squander your emotional energy on everything. You learn to choose your battles, to save your sadness for real sorrows, to hide your joy for joys that deserve it.

This is not suppression of feelings, but their rationalization. Suppression stores pressure until it explodes. Rationalization directs energy toward what deserves it.

In the new school, I was the stranger twice: Sudanese in a Gulf country, and relatively poor in a wealthier society. I learned to hide, to observe, to understand the rules before playing.

---

## Chapter Fifteen: The Dialectic of Belonging

The question **"Where are you from?"** became complicated. The easy answer "from Sudan" was no longer enough. I'm from Sudan but I live in Saudi Arabia. I speak with a Sudanese accent but understand the Saudi accent. My memories are there but my present is here.

Dual identity is not doubled belonging, but divided belonging. Sometimes you feel you belong everywhere, and sometimes nowhere.

I began to understand that identity is not something fixed you're born with, but something you build continuously. Every experience adds a layer, every belonging leaves a trace. **I am layers of Sudan and Saudi Arabia, of childhood and adolescence, of poverty and ambition.**

I don't need to choose one layer, I can be all layers together.

---

## Chapter Sixteen: Patience as Formation

The desert creates patience. No other choice. You wait for rain that may not come. You wait for coolness that only comes at night. You wait for opportunity that may or may not come.

I learned that **patience is not passivity, but strategy**. The patient doesn't surrender, but chooses timing. Studies conditions, gathers strength, waits for the right moment. Then moves decisively.

**The camel** became my favorite symbol. An animal designed for the desert, stores water and energy, walks with steady slowness that doesn't waver, always arrives. Doesn't run like a horse, doesn't jump like a gazelle, but reaches where you want to go, however long the road.

In school, I applied this philosophy. I didn't try to excel immediately, but built a solid foundation slowly. Studied, understood, consolidated, then launched.

---

## Chapter Seventeen: Language as Bridge and Barrier

In Saudi Arabia, I discovered that Arabic is not one language. My Sudanese accent was strange here, sometimes funny, sometimes incomprehensible. I had to learn a "new language" within my language.

This experience affected my relationship with language generally. I understood that language is not just words, but a complete system of values, implications, and contexts. Changing accent means partially changing way of thinking.

Later, when I learned English more deeply, I understood this more. **Every language is a different world**. Arabic thinks one way, and English thinks another. The ability to navigate between languages means the ability to navigate between worlds.

---

## Chapter Eighteen: Ambition as Fuel

In the desert, water is precious. In my life, **ambition** was precious the same way. The energy source that makes movement possible, that gives survival meaning.

My ambition wasn't clear-featured at first. I didn't know what I wanted to become, but I knew I wanted to **"become"**. This verb itself, transformation, evolution, transition from one state to a better state.

High school was the crystallization phase. I began inclining toward sciences, toward understanding how things work:
- **Chemistry** enchanted me: the idea that different materials are just different arrangements of the same atoms
- **Physics** amazed me: simple laws governing a complex universe
- **Biology** aroused my curiosity: complex machines calling themselves "life"

**Medicine** was the natural choice. Combines all sciences, deals with humans, achieves direct benefit.

Or so I thought.

---

## Chapter Nineteen: Study Nights

Study sessions were my new ritual. Books open, coffee cold, and the mind grinding information. Not because I love studying this way, but because it's the necessary price.

In those nights, I learned things about myself:
- I discovered I'm capable of focusing for hours if the goal is clear
- I discovered physical fatigue doesn't matter if the mind is engaged
- I discovered dreams nourish more than food

There were moments of doubt. **Why do I do this? Is it worth it? What if I fail?**

But I learned not to trust 3 AM thoughts. **Dark thoughts love dark hours, and disappear with dawn**.

---

## Chapter Twenty: The Gateway to Medicine

Acceptance to medical school was a tectonic moment. All previous layers — poverty, collapse, migration, patience — were preparation for this moment. The door I dreamed of finally opened.

But joy was mixed with fear. **Can I do it? Am I truly qualified? Will I disappoint those who trust me?**

"Impostor syndrome" as I would learn later, that internal voice saying "you're not good enough, and they'll discover that soon."

The call with my mother was difficult. Her voice trembling with joy and sadness together. Joy for my success, and sadness that I'm moving further away.

**"Maki the Father,"** my grandfather, had passed years before. But I felt his presence at that moment. The seed he planted began to bear fruit.

---

# Part Three: Dissecting the Terrain
**(Medicine: Discovering the Limits of Healing)**

---

## Chapter Twenty-One: The Body as Map
### The Fourth Teacher: Pain

Medicine taught me to read the body as a geological map. Every organ a layer, every disease a crack, every symptom a signal to something deeper. But the map traditional medicine draws was incomplete.

We were studying organs as if they were separate. Heart one department, lungs one department, liver one department. But **the body doesn't work like this**. Everything is connected to everything. A change in one place affects every other place.

**The system is one whole, and we tear it apart to study it.**

This tearing is necessary for understanding, but dangerous for treatment. When you treat the organ without seeing the system, you treat the symptom without understanding the cause. You might succeed temporarily, but you haven't solved the real problem.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Two: The Hospital as Laboratory

Clinical training was immersion in reality. Diseases were no longer names in books, but faces and stories and worried families. Patient number 23 in ward 4 has a name and history and unrealized dreams.

I saw **death** up close for the first time. Not in the anatomy lab where everything is clean and organized, but in the intensive care room where machines scream and nurses run and family waits behind the glass door.

A moment when the heart stops, and the human becomes a body.

I asked myself: **What exactly happened? Where did the person go?** The body itself is present, the cells didn't disappear, but something left. That thing that left, can we understand it scientifically? Or is it beyond the scope of science entirely?

The hospital also taught me about **complex human systems**. Not just the biological system of the body, but the social system of the institution. Hierarchy, information flow, responsibility distribution — all this affects care quality as much as medicine does.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Three: Doctors as Small Gods

In the hospital, I discovered that doctors are treated as small gods. Patients await their word as if it were revelation, nurses execute their orders, administrators deal with them reverentially.

This power is **intoxicating and dangerous**.

I saw doctors use this power wisely, and others abuse it. I saw those who listen to patients patiently, and those who interrupt them after seconds. I saw those who explain humbly, and those who show off with incomprehensible terminology.

I decided I wouldn't be the second type. **Power is a trust, and knowledge is a responsibility**. The patient is not just a case, but a frightened, suffering human placing trust in you.

But I also noticed that the medical system itself creates this dynamic. Training focuses on technical knowledge more than human skills. **The system produces what it rewards.**

---

## Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limits of Treatment

The deeper I went into medicine, the more I saw its limits:
- We often treat symptoms, not cure diseases
- We slow deterioration, not reverse it
- We save from death, not restore life

A diabetic patient comes every month. We adjust insulin dose, advise diet, warn of complications. Then she returns the next month with the same problem or worse. An endless cycle.

**Why?**

Because we're not treating the cause of her diabetes. Her environment, her available food, her psychological pressures, her inherited habits, the dietary system of the entire society. All this is outside the prescription's scope, but inside the problem's scope.

I began to understand that **individual medicine is limited by nature**. You treat one person at a time, while disease is produced by a system affecting millions.

Like emptying the ocean with a spoon. Noble effort, but insufficient.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Five: The Disturbing Question

In the final year of studies, I asked myself a disturbing question:

**Is this what I want to do with my life? Treat patient after patient, in a system that doesn't change, producing the same diseases endlessly?**

This wasn't skepticism about medicine's value. Doctors make real differences in individual lives. But I wondered: **Can a bigger difference be made differently? Can the system itself be treated, not just its victims?**

This question had no clear answer. I graduated from medical school carrying it with me.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Six: The Impossible Specialty

During internship and training, I tried different specialties. Internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, radiology. Each specialty its own world, with its culture and language and values.

**Radiology** particularly attracted me. The ability to see inside without opening the body. Images that reveal what the body hides. Technology that expands our senses.

But I noticed something. The radiologist sees the image, not the patient. Reads the film, writes the report, sends to referring physician. **No meeting, no conversation, no relationship.**

This disconnection bothered me. I want to see **the complete system**, not part of it. I want to understand how the image connects to the patient to the doctor to the hospital to society.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Seven: Early Burnout

Professional burnout struck early. I'm not alone — my colleagues suffer too. Long hours, heavy responsibility, dealing with pain and death daily. All this drains.

But my burnout was different. It wasn't just physical or emotional fatigue, but **existential fatigue**. I feel I'm in the wrong place, doing the wrong thing the wrong way.

Not because medicine is bad, but because it's **not enough** for what I want to achieve.

I started reading outside medicine. Books about:
- Complex systems
- Systems thinking
- Institutional change

I discovered a world of ideas not taught in medical school. Ideas about how systems work, how they change, how they can be designed better.

These readings were the beginning of transformation.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Transition

The decision to leave clinical practice wasn't easy. Years of study and training, family expectations, identity built on "I am a doctor." All this must be reconsidered.

But I learned that **sunk costs shouldn't determine the future**. What I invested in the past shouldn't imprison me in it. If I discovered a better path, I must have the courage to take it.

The transition was gradual. I began working on projects combining medicine and technology. I discovered there's demand for those who understand both worlds. That there's a **gap** between those who know technology and those who know healthcare, and I could be a bridge.

I didn't abandon medicine, but expanded its definition.

---

## Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Vision Crystallizes

Somewhere between medicine and technology and systems science, I found what I was searching for. Not one specialty, but an **intersection**. Not one answer, but a framework for thinking.

**Systems thinking** became my primary tool:
- Instead of looking at the problem in isolation, I look at the system producing it
- Instead of treating symptoms, I search for points where the entire system can be affected

**Healthcare is a complex system:**
Hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, patients, doctors, governments, technology. All these elements interact in complex ways, producing outcomes no one wants.

Understanding this system is a condition for changing it.

**Technology is the tool of change:**
Artificial intelligence, data analysis, automation. These aren't magic solutions, but they can achieve things impossible by traditional means.

---

## Chapter Thirty: The End of the Beginning

I emerged from the medicine phase with something more precious than the degree: **a vision**.

- A vision of what healthcare could be
- A vision of my role in achieving this change
- An incomplete vision, but clear enough to guide the next steps

I didn't regret the years of medicine. They taught me to understand the human body, to deal with suffering, to bear responsibility.

But I also realized that **medicine alone is not enough**:
- It treats individuals, not systems
- It reacts to disease, doesn't prevent it
- It responds to symptoms, doesn't change causes

For real change, I must exit the clinic to a wider world.

This exit is not escape, but **expansion**:
- From doctor to systems engineer
- From healer to designer
- From practitioner to builder

**The third transformation in my geological journey.**

---

# Part Four: Engineering the Horizon
**(The Engine: Building What Wasn't Built)**

---

## Chapter Thirty-One: Birth of the Idea

The idea didn't come as sudden inspiration. It came as slow accumulation, like a sedimentary layer forming over years. Every observation about healthcare system failure, every question about improvement possibility, every reading about technology and systems — all accumulated until reaching **critical mass**.

The central question was:

**How can artificial intelligence be used to improve healthcare in the Arab region?**

A broad question, perhaps too broad, but it was the starting point.

In Saudi Arabia, **Vision 2030** was opening doors. Comprehensive digital transformation, massive technology investments, genuine desire to develop the health sector. The environment prepared for something new.

But the idea needs more than favorable environment. It needs **team, funding, execution**. It needs transforming vision to reality, dream to plan, plan to action.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Two: BrainSAIT — Birth of the Name

The company name came from the intersection of identity and mission:

**"Brain"** for mind and intelligence

**"SAIT"** as abbreviation for **"Solutions that are Automated and Integrated with Technology"**

But it's also pronounced close to "Bra'een Sayt" in colloquial, and "sayt" means reputation and impact.

**The name carries a philosophy:** We use minds to develop integrated technical solutions. Not technology for its own sake, but technology in service of humanity. Not automation just to save money, but to free humans for work only they can do.

**Establishment:**
- Company founded in Britain (flexible legal structure, access to global markets)
- Real work in Saudi Arabia (where need and opportunity exist)
- **Official OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.61026)** — recognized in the world of international health standards

Not just a startup, but a participant in **global infrastructure for health data**.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Three: Building the Tools

Big ideas are realized with small tools. I began building what I call **"Smart Agents"** — AI systems specialized in specific tasks:

### **ClaimLinc**
Analyzing insurance claim rejections. Hospitals lose millions due to errors in claim submission. A smart system that learns from previous errors, predicts rejection before it happens, suggests corrections.

### **PolicyLinc**
Interpreting insurance policies. Complex documents in legal language, constantly changing. A system that reads and understands them and answers user questions in simple language.

### **ClinicalLinc**
Clinical decision support. Not to replace the doctor, but to assist. Gathers information, suggests possibilities, alerts to drug interactions.

### **TTLINC**
Medical translation between Arabic and English. Not literal translation, but translation that understands medical and cultural context.

**Each tool is a solution to a real problem I saw during my practice.** Not technology searching for a problem, but problems that found their technological solutions.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Four: MASTERLINC — The Central Engine

At some point, I realized separate tools aren't enough. Need something to unify them, coordinate between them, make them work as one system.

**Here MASTERLINC was born.**

**MASTERLINC** is the upper coordination layer:
- Receives tasks
- Distributes them to appropriate tools
- Collects results
- Presents them to user
- Learns from every interaction
- Improves over time
- Adapts to changing needs

**The idea is inspired by the human body itself:**

The brain doesn't do everything itself, but coordinates between specialized organs. Each organ does what it does best, and the brain combines all that into unified behavior.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Five: Compliance as Foundation

In healthcare, compliance with standards is not optional:
- **HIPAA** (American privacy)
- **NPHIES** (Saudi system)
- **FHIR R4** (international data standards)

I built compliance into the **system's core**, not as a later addition. Every design decision passes through a filter: Is this secure? Does it protect privacy? Does it comply with standards?

### **ComplianceLinc**
Internal audit system:
- Continuously monitors
- Records every data access
- Alerts to any potential violation
- Not a guard after the incident, but prevention before it

**The challenge in Saudi Arabia is doubled:** international standards and local standards. **NPHIES** is the national interoperability system, and everyone working in healthcare must integrate with it.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Six: The Team
### The Sixth Teacher: Maki the Son

No one builds something great alone. I needed a team that shares the vision and completes my shortcomings:
- Programmers who understand health
- Health experts who understand technology
- Designers who understand the Arab user

**Building the team is harder than building technology.** Technology follows clear rules, humans don't. Each person has their motivations and ambitions and fears. Gathering them around a common goal is more art than science.

I learned that **leadership is not giving orders, but creating an environment where others can excel**. To trust your team, delegate to them, take responsibility for their mistakes and attribute successes to them.

**"Maki the Son,"** my son, became part of the motivation. I build this not just for me, but for the next generation. To show him that big dreams are possible, that failure is part of the path, and that a person can make a difference.

---

## Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Challenges

The road wasn't straight. Technical, financial, bureaucratic, human obstacles. Each nearly stopped the project, but each taught a lesson.

### **The Technical Challenge**
Technology changes at amazing speed. What you build today might become old tomorrow.
**Solution:** Building for flexibility, not perfection. Systems that adapt, evolve, change with needs.

### **The Financial Challenge**
Startups need time before they profit. Cash flow management, searching for investment, balancing growth and sustainability.

### **The Human Challenge**
The team changes, members leave and others join. Maintaining culture and vision amidst this change. Building an institution that continues beyond any individual.

### **The Personal Challenge**
Balance between work and life. My health, my family, my relationships. All this needs time I don't always have.

**I learned that success without health or family is not real success.**

---

## Chapter Thirty-Eight: Vision 2030

**Saudi Vision 2030** is not just a government plan, but an existential transformation for an entire society:
- Economic diversification
- Digital transformation
- Developing non-oil sectors
- Healthcare is a central part of this transformation

**BrainSAIT was born in and for this context.** We are part of the new Saudi dream, contributors to building it. Not as spectators, but as actors.

Working with government institutions opened horizons I hadn't imagined. Access to decision-making, ability to influence, partnership in building the future.

But this comes with **doubled responsibility**. We don't just represent ourselves, but represent the possibility of what Saudis and Arabs can do in the technology field.

**Every success opens the door for others, and every failure might close it.**

---

## Chapter Thirty-Nine: System and Individual

Returning to the question I began with in medical school:

**How do you balance between seeing the system and seeing the individual? How do you understand the machine without becoming a machine? How do you build systems without forgetting they serve humans?**

The answer I reached:

**The tension between levels is healthy and necessary.** You shouldn't choose between them, but move between them. Sometimes you look at the forest, sometimes at the tree. Both are real, both are important.

In my daily work, this means I design systems but don't forget the end user:
- The nurse who will use the system at 3 AM while exhausted
- The doctor who needs an answer in seconds
- The patient who doesn't understand technology but deserves to benefit from it

**Technology is a tool, not a goal.** The goal is alleviating suffering, improving health, giving humans better lives.

If we forget this, we become merely **builders of meaningless machines**.

## Chapter Forty: The Continuing Road

There is no end to this story because it hasn't ended yet. I'm in the middle of the journey, perhaps at its beginning. What I've achieved so far is foundation for what's coming, not final achievement.

**The geology of the soul continues:**
- New layers form every day
- New cracks appear, heal, leave their traces
- The engine doesn't stop rotating
- Fuel doesn't run out as long as there's vision and purpose

I remember the child who sat on the Nile's bank throwing pebbles. He wondered about his place in the world, about the meaning of his existence, about the difference he could make.

That child still exists somewhere inside me, still asking the same questions.

But something changed:
- I no longer search for ready answers, but build my answers with my hands
- I no longer wait for opportunities, but create them
- I no longer see cracks as endings, but as beginnings

**The Crack and the Engine:** this is the title of my life.
- The cracks that shaped me
- And the engine that drives me
- The past that Sudan left inside me
- And the future I'm building in Saudi Arabia and beyond

# Conclusion: The Map Expands

When I began this writing, I thought I was drawing a map of what passed. I discovered I'm drawing **a map of what's coming too**.

Geology doesn't stop, layers continue forming, and humans continue transforming.

### **To the Reader Who Reached Here:**

This is not a success story in the traditional sense. There's no final victory moment, no huge wealth, no widespread fame. This is a story of **continuous journey**, with its victories and defeats, its clarity and ambiguity.

What I hope you take from these pages is not the details of my life, but **the framework through which I saw these details:**

✦ That every crack can become a source of new strength
✦ That previous layers don't imprison you but build you
✦ That understanding systems doesn't cancel individual importance, but expands ability to influence

**My map still expands.**
**I hope yours expands too.**

## Letter to the Reader

My dear reader,

If you've read these pages to the end, you now know things about me that my closest people don't know. This creates between us a strange bond, **the bond of words that break barriers**.

I don't know who you are, don't know your circumstances or dreams or fears. But I know you're a human searching for something, or else you wouldn't have finished reading. Perhaps you're searching for inspiration, perhaps understanding, perhaps just company between pages.

Whatever you're searching for, I hope you've found something worthwhile. Not necessarily in my words, but in **the thoughts my words stirred in your mind**.

The best thing any book does is make you think, not think for you.

### **If You're Going Through a Crack in Your Life Now:**

I want you to know that **cracks are not endings. They are disguised beginnings.** Everything seems impossible before it happens, then becomes part of the past whose story you tell.

### **If You're Searching for Your Engine:**

For the thing that drives you and gives your life meaning, **don't rush**. Engines are built slowly, from experiences and readings and relationships and reflections. Continue building, even if you don't see the complete machine yet.

And finally, if you want to communicate, I'm here. Not because I have answers, but because I love questions. **And because the most beautiful thing about the journey is sharing it with others.**

With all the sincerity I can muster,
